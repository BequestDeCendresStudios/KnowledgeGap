# KnowledgeGap
This repository is for studying the way the mind represses memories and explores its own inner thought process.

## Narrative Context
My research focuses on Neurosymbolic AI and Metalearning to model the subconscious mind's structure—specifically, how it resolves contradictions and represses trauma. This AI methodology is directly informed by the world-building of my dreampunk novel/webcomic, set in a post-civil-war North America defined by the cultural and linguistic fusion of French and Japanese territories. My system uses concepts like Sabofensu and Saborakku to scientifically model the psychological coping mechanisms required to manage such profound, historical trauma.

## My AI System
My project is built on Neurosymbolic AI using Metalearning between a committee of experts. Neuro-Symbolic AI are known for reducing the hallucinations that Neural Networks are prone to.

My own approach is specifically for addressing known issues with Neural Networks.

## Features
Even if a logical rule based on an abstract representation of its dream state "collapses", represented by the reversing of an index, it can reconstruct a logical rule by approximating the closest English equivalent.

## Sabofensu and Saborakku
### Sabofensu
Primarily serves to finalize a lack of knowledge and closer to forgetting information.<br />

### Saborakku
Primarily serves to allow for a grace period for where shoes / clogs is allowed to find a "different wearer."

In practice this means that saborakku is "wabisabi" for shoes ( which represents knowledge in this system ).

## Future Direction
I'm wanting to build a system that could be called "Mixture Of Meta-Learners", or learning how to learn meta-rules.

### Specific Terminology
#### Knowledge Gaps
Used specifically to study repressed memories and blind spots in self-awareness.

### Dream State
Dream state refers to aspects of the subconscious mind that isn't bound by the same standards of logic.

### Reversing of an Index / Reconstructing a Logical Rule
This is analogous to how the mind resolves contradictions, integrates new  experience, or performs therapy/re-evaluation of core beliefs.

### Poupee / Dolls
Dolls here represent the way the mind copes with repressed memories.
