This is slightly different from normal machine learning as its designed to track knowledge gaps.

My project is built on Neurosymbolic AI using Metalearning between a committee of experts. Neuro-Symbolic AI are known for reducing the hallucinations that Neural Networks are prone to.

My own approach is specifically for addressing known issues with Neural Networks.
