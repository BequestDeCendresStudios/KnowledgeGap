# KnowledgeGap
This is slightly different from normal machine learning as its designed to track knowledge gaps.

## My AI System
My project is built on Neurosymbolic AI using Metalearning between a committee of experts. Neuro-Symbolic AI are known for reducing the hallucinations that Neural Networks are prone to.

My own approach is specifically for addressing known issues with Neural Networks.

## Features
Even if a logical rule based on an abstract representation of its dream state "collapses", represented by the reversing of an index, it can reconstruct a logical rule by approximating the closest English equivalent.
