# KnowledgeGap
This repository is for studying the way the mind represses memories and explores its own inner thought process.

## My AI System
My project is built on Neurosymbolic AI using Metalearning between a committee of experts. Neuro-Symbolic AI are known for reducing the hallucinations that Neural Networks are prone to.

My own approach is specifically for addressing known issues with Neural Networks.

## Features
Even if a logical rule based on an abstract representation of its dream state "collapses", represented by the reversing of an index, it can reconstruct a logical rule by approximating the closest English equivalent.

## Sabofensu and Saborakku
Sabofensu - primarily serves to finalize a lack of knowledge and closer to forgetting information.<br />
Saborakku - primarily serves to allow for a grace period for where shoes / clogs is allowed to find a "different wearer."

In practice this means that saborakku is "wabisabi" for shoes ( which represents knowledge in this system ).

## Future Direction
I'm wanting to build a system that could be called "Mixture Of Meta-Learners", or learning how to learn meta-rules.

### Specific Terminology
#### Knowledge Gaps
Used specifically to study repressed memories and blind spots in self-awareness.

### Dream State
Dream state refers to aspects of the subconscious mind that isn't bound by the same standards of logic.

### Reversing of an Index / Reconstructing a Logical Rule
This is analogous to how the mind resolves contradictions, integrates new  experience, or performs therapy/re-evaluation of core beliefs.

### Poupee / Dolls
Dolls here represent the way the mind copes with repressed memories.
